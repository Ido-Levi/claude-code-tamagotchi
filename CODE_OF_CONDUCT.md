# Code of Conduct üåà

## Our Pet-Friendly Promise

We're building a community that's as warm and welcoming as a happy pet greeting you after a long day. Everyone should feel safe, respected, and excited to be here.

## The Simple Version

- **Be excellent to each other** 
- **Be the person your pet thinks you are**
- **Code with kindness**

## The Detailed Version

### Yes! Do These Things! ‚úÖ

- **Welcome newcomers** - Everyone was new once
- **Share knowledge** - Help others level up
- **Give constructive feedback** - Build up, don't tear down
- **Respect different perspectives** - Diversity makes us stronger
- **Take breaks** - Your pet would want you to!
- **Have fun** - This is supposed to be enjoyable!

### Nope! Don't Do These! ‚ùå

- **Harassment** - Not cool, ever
- **Discrimination** - All humans (and pets) are welcome
- **Trolling** - Save your energy for coding
- **Being a jerk** - Your pet would be disappointed
- **Spam** - Nobody likes spam (except maybe in musubi)

## If Something's Wrong

See something that doesn't feel right? Here's what to do:

1. **If you're comfortable** - Kindly point it out to the person
2. **If not** - Reach out to a maintainer
3. **If it's serious** - Report it immediately

We take all reports seriously and will handle them with care and confidentiality.

## Enforcement

If someone's repeatedly making the community unpleasant:
1. **First** - A friendly private reminder
2. **Second** - A public reminder
3. **Third** - Temporary timeout
4. **Fourth** - Permanent ban from the pet park

## Remember

We're all here because we love coding and want a friendly companion along for the ride. Let's keep this space as delightful as watching your pet's happiness hit 100%.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from various awesome communities who also believe in being excellent to each other.
