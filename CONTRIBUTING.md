# Contributing to Claude Code Tamagotchi 🐾

Hey there, awesome human! Thanks for wanting to make Claude Code Tamagotchi even better! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or just improving docs, we're stoked to have you here. 

## The Vibe ✨

This project is all about making coding more fun and less lonely. Your pet is there for you during those 3am debugging sessions, celebrates your wins, and reminds you to take breaks. Keep that energy when contributing!

## How to Contribute 🚀

### Found a Bug? 🐛
- Check if someone already reported it in Issues
- If not, open a new issue with:
  - What you expected to happen
  - What actually happened  
  - Your setup (OS, Claude Code version, etc.)
  - Bonus points for screenshots!

### Want to Add Something Cool? 💡
1. **Check existing issues** - maybe someone's already on it
2. **Open an issue first** - let's chat about your idea!
3. **Fork & create a branch** - name it something fun like `feature/pet-does-backflips`
4. **Make your magic happen** - code it up!
5. **Test your changes** - make sure your pet still works
6. **Submit a PR** - we'll review it with love

## Code Style 💅

- **TypeScript** - Keep those types tight!
- **Readable > Clever** - Your future self will thank you
- **Comments** - Only when needed, make them count
- **Pet Personality** - Keep thoughts fun and varied
- **No emojis in code** - Save them for the pet's thoughts!

## Adding Pet Thoughts 💭

The thought system is the pet's personality! When adding thoughts:
- Keep them short and sweet
- Mix technical humor with genuine care
- Avoid being mean or negative
- Remember: the pet loves its human!

Check out `src/engine/thoughts/` for examples.

## Testing 🧪

Before submitting:
1. Run `bun run build` - should build without errors
2. Test all commands - `/pet-feed`, `/pet-play`, etc.
3. Let the pet run for a few minutes - check for weird behavior
4. Make sure thoughts appear and rotate properly

## The Golden Rules 🌟

1. **Be kind** - We're all here to have fun
2. **Be patient** - Maintainers have pet care duties too
3. **Be creative** - Weird ideas often become the best features
4. **Be yourself** - Your unique perspective makes this better

## Questions? 

Open an issue labeled "question" or reach out! We don't bite (but the pet might nibble affectionately).
