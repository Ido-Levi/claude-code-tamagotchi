description: Feed your pet (pizza, cookie, sushi, apple, burger, donut, ramen, taco)

Feed the pet using this command:

!claude-code-tamagotchi feed $ARGUMENTS

Then tell the user something fun like: "Your pet just devoured that $ARGUMENTS like it was their last meal! They're doing a little happy dance now... or maybe that's just indigestion? 🍕💃"
